### Configuration

We try our best to create an out-of-the-box theme, let you forget about complex configuration items and really focus on writing.

But we still provide some basic configuration items for personalized configuration, these configurations are not necessary.

Go to [VuePress | Config Reference](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/config/) to get the basic configuration items supported by `VuePress`. All the basic configurations supported in the `VuePress` document are also applicable in this theme.

Test description about this part of code:
```php
<?php
echo str_word_count("PHP");
?> 
```
